Final Project Notes
There are three (3) main pages that I've been working on for this project - the landing page, event creation page, and preview page.

Landing Page
- The UI was the focus for this page as I wanted the design to be simple and welcoming. This is why you only see the top header and the welcome message. You are able to scroll down and see more of the "story" of Fether, but I like how if you already know the website there's no fluff upon entry.
- Main strengths are UI/UX

Event Creation Page
- Easily where most of the work I've spent on this project. It was necessary to start on paper to get the idea of "flow" for this page. I asked for feedback from family, and went over a lot of different variations of what to make the page look like. Conveying simplicity, while also making it capable of complex planning, was difficult.
- Main strengths are the UI/UX, the Event Progress tracker, and interactive buttons.

Preview Page
- This is what the participant will see when they get the link. I had to add a way to vote on options and display the voted option costs. The view selection summary is essentially the itinerary of the event assuming the voted options are finalized.


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
